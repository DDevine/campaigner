CAMPAIGNER

What is campaigner:
This is just a simple PHP module that can create a box on your website to collectnames and email addresses of supporters. I wrote this because I needed it for my self so I canÂ´t garantee if this is useful for someone else, right? But why not release it anyways.

Installation:
You have to put the campaigner subfolder on your webserver and call the show and listen calls as described in the example
You also need a mysql database with the structure described below. 
You should also look at the style.css and put a config.php file based on config.sample.php into your parent directory to change the layout, the texts and the working to your needs.


MySQL Dump:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `supporter` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `status` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `timestamp` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `confirmhash` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;
